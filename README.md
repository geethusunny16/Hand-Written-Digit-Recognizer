# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognizer
 ## Import Libraries
In this notebook I have created a model which recognize hand weitten digits.
## Load Dataset
The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)- its a inbuilt dataset in tensorflow
The Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset is abbreviated as MNIST and is made up of various types of data. 
The dataset contains 70,000 handwritten single digits between 0 and 9 on 28 pixel grayscale images

## Normalization of Input Data
Normalization helps get data within a range and reduces the skewness which helps learn faster and better .
it increases computatoon speed.Image pixel size is  0 to 255 ,to normalize we divide with 255 to have pixel range in between [0,1]
## Data Visualization
## CNN model
CNN consists of Input layer, convolution layer, Activation function, Pooling layer, fully connected layer
## Web-Application of this Model using gradio package
Gradio - open source python library to   build  web appliction
